                        My father's name is Jeff Lator. He works at Rockwell Automation as
                        a Project Test Engineer. In his free time, he enjoys watching sports,
                        especially football and baseball. He is a big fan of the Milwaukee
                        Brewers and the Chicago Bears. He also likes working on old cars. He
                        has a 1966 Volkswagen Bus that he has been restoring for the past five years.
                        Through this restoration project, he has taught me a lot about mechanics and
                        the importance of patience and attention to detail.

                        My mother's name is Tiffany Lator. She is a teacher at the local middle school,
                        where she teaches seventh-grade english. She is passionate about education and loves
                        helping her students develop their reading and writing skills. Before going back as a 
                        full time teacher, she worked as a paraprofessional at the same middle school. In her free time,
                        she enjoys watching me and my brother play sports, cooking, and volunteering. It is
                        safe to say she is me and my brother's biggest fans; she is at every one of our sports games 
                        cheering us on. She has taught me a lot about the importance of hard work, dedication, and kindness.

                        My brother's name is Cooper Lator. He is 15 years old and is currently a sophomore
                        in high school. He is very athletic and plays on the school's baseball and basketball teams.
                        While it doens't look like he'll follow the same career path as me, he is very interested in
                        business and entrepreneurship. In his free time, he enjoys playing video games and hanging out 
                        with his friends. He is very competitive and always strives to be the best at whatever he does.
                        He has taught me a lot about teamwork, perseverance, and the value of a positive attitude.
