                I am a second year student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison
                studing Computer Engineering and Computer Science. I hope to use my schooling
                to achieve my goal of continuing to innovate the future of technology.
                I hope to one day be a part of a team that helps innovate semiconductor technology,
                leaving a lasting impact on the world around me.

                <p>
                    Wisconsin Racing is an engineering club at UW-Madison that designs, builds and tests
                    an electric high-downforce, lightweight, formula style race car. In the fall of 2025,
                    I joined the electrical team to gain more exprience building PCBs and designing physical
                    electrical components. I am currently working on a Differential Pressure Sensor board that
                    will live under the car to measure and collect pressure difference data for the aerodynamic
                    team.

                <p>
                    UW-Madison's IEEE chapter is a club made up of mostly Electrical Engineers and Computer Engineers.
                    The main goal of the club is to expose undergraduate engineers to more application experience.
                    Since the fall of 2024, I have learned about different jobs in industry, different industry standards, and
                    how to apply what I have learned in my classes into physical projects.
