                        In my free time, I enjoy a variety of hobbies. One of my favorite pastimes is baseball.
                        I have played baseball my whole life, starting when I was just four years old. I love the
                        camaraderie of being part of a team, as well as the thrill of competition. In addition to
                        my own playing, I also enjoy listening to Brewers games on the radio. I prefer listening
                        to games rather than watching them on TV because it allows me to multitask and do other things
                        such as homework or chores while still following the action. The radio announcers also tend to provide
                        more detailed play-by-play commentary, which enhances my understanding and enjoyment of the game.

                    <p>
                        Another thing I enjoy doing in my free time is watching and playing football. While I never
                        played tackle football, I played a lot of flag football when I was young. Because of my experience
                        with baseball, I was a pretty good quarterback. Outside of playing, I enjoy watching games. My
                        favorite team is the Chicago Bears, however I enjoy sitting down to watch any team play. In addition
                        to professional football, I enjoy watching college football. Going to school at UW-Madison, I especially
                        enjoy watching the Badgers play. I look forward to Saturday home games during the college football season.

                    <p>
                        In addition to baseball and football, I enjoy watching and playing basketball. I played organized
                        recreational basketball fourth grade through eighth grade. Although my competitive playing days
                        are definitely over, I still enjoy watching the game. I am a big fan of the Milwaukee Bucks and really
                        enjoy watching them play on TV. I also enjoy watching college basketball. March is one of my favorite
                        months of the year beacuse of March Madness. I enjoy filling out brackets and watching the games, hoping
                        the teams I picked win.

                        All these sports are fun to play or watch by myself. However, they are much more fun to do with friends.
                        I love to spend time with my friends. We always make an effor to get together on game days to wath the games
                        together, sometimes multitasking homework just so we can all be together. Outside of sports, we enjoy exploring
                        the outdoors through camping trips, Lake Michigan beach days, or just some
